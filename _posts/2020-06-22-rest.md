Today, we're learning all about REST (Representational State Transfer) and how to implement it with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

## Project

Tonight, go through the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/) tutorial. Tomorrow, you'll implement an API for your QuestionBox app. You can start early on that if you like.
