Today, we need to talk about [full-text search](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/search/). There are two other topics we should touch on, but may run out of time -- [class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/class-based-views/) and [returning JSON from a Django view](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/request-response/#jsonresponse-objects).

## Project

This weekend, you need to finish up Question Box. Next week we'll start a new project building a REST API in Django. We'll talk during class about whether you all would rather add the API to Question Box or start a whole new project.
