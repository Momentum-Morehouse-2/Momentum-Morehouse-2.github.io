## Assignment

[Complete the official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). For the section "Setup for the Tutorial," choose option 2.

This project does not have to be in Git.

## Resources

- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) - an alternative tutorial. Good info, but a different approach than the official one.
