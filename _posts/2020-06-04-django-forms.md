Today we're continuing to work with views and forms. Specifically, we'll see how to edit models through forms, as well as how to customize the HTML of your forms and add some JavaScript.

## Project

This weekend should be a big push for you! You need to have all the forms for your project done, allowing for editing of models and deleting models. At the end of the weekend you should have at a minimum a simple, working version of your project. The UI may not be where you want it, and you might have features to add, but it should be something you can use.
