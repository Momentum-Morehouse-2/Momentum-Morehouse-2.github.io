Today we're going to learn all about the React lifecycle and how you can use it to make applications that retrieve and store data.

## Project

[React Trivia Game](https://classroom.github.com/a/iQCme5Su) -- this is due on Thursday.

## Resources

- [State and Lifecycle from the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- [React Lifecycle Methods in Plain Approachable Language](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-new-react-lifecycle-methods-in-plain-approachable-language-61a2105859f3/) -- I didn't love this article, but it does really break it down.
- [Video on React Lifecycle Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iHepe36m0c&feature=youtu.be)
- If you are having a hard time not mutating your state in React, try [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction).
