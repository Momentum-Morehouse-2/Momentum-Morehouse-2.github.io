## Today's topics

- Working in a shared repo

## Resources

- [GitHub Collaboration Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)
- [Git in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol) -> I use git on the command line and that's how I teach people to use it. But you might like using the integration in VS Code. This is a good place to start, but there are many other extensions that you could use as well.
- [Pair Programming Guide](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/template) -> This template for a pairing session is practical and actionable. There are other resources on this site worth a look as well.
