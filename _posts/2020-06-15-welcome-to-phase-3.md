Good morning and welcome to Phase 3! I'll be making separate posts for each sub-team from here on out.

One note before we get started: you'll notice some repositories, including your homework repos, using the branch `main` instead of `master`. This is an intentional change based off discussions around the historical meaning of "master," and is in line with changes GitHub is planning on making in the future.

Some repos -- like the one for this blog -- will not yet change because of technical limitations. We cannot post to GitHub Pages without the traditional branch name yet.

If you want to do the same on older repositories you have, read [Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx).
