This week, you'll be building a Django project from scratch. Each day, we'll dig deeper into the tools you will need.

The current plan is:

- Monday: creating a new Django project, registration and login, admin
- Tuesday: model relationships, model queries
- Wednesday: creating models with forms and views
- Thursday: Ajax and Django (or review, catchup)

## Project

* [Django from Scratch](https://classroom.github.com/a/bg6cFZKz). Clone this project, pick which you're going to work on, and create a new project. Add registration and login today.

## Resources

* [django-registration-redux](https://django-registration-redux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* [Python dependency management overview](https://modelpredict.com/python-dependency-management-tools) - good read to understand pip and poetry better
