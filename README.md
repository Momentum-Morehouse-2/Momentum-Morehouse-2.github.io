## Welcome to the Momentum Team 1 blog

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/momentum-team-1/momentum-team-1.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### About posts

All posts should be composed under the `_posts` folder with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. Replace all parts of the filename with the appropriate date for your post.

All posts should have [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). This front matter should contain a `title` and `tags`, with tags including the phase and the topics of the day. It should also contain a `layout` of `post`. A sample front matter:

```
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to your first day of class
tags: phase-1 command-line git
---
```

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Running locally

To run this locally, run the command `bundle install`. Once this is run, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run this application locally and preview your changes.

This assumes you have Ruby and Bundler installed. If you do not, consult their documentation to figure out how to install them for your system.
