# Demo Presentation Guide

Your team has 5-6 minutes of presentation time, followed by 10-12 minutes of Q&A time with panelists.

_Each person on your team should be prepared to answer questions_. Decide ahead of time who will take what type of questions.

## Example Presentation

The following recording shows a student presentation from the last demo day we held in April. *Please note that this includes a video with sound, which is NOT what you are doing!*

It's useful because this team did a great job of telling their story, and the Q&A section is included for you to get a sense of what that might be like.

Here's an example from Cohort 2 in a different format. This was a live, in-person presentation with an accompanying video. No Q&A.

## Tell the story of your app and your team

This is your public debut as a technologist. Show your confidence, enthusiasm, ability to learn a lot in a short time, and readiness to contribute as part of a professional development team.

### Structure of Presentation

1. Describe your app and what it does, concisely in 1-2 sentences. Example: "8-Track is an app that lets you build a to-do list for listening to your music."
2. Why did you build this? What is the central problem you are solving?
3. Each developer talks about some feature of the app that they worked on.
4. Conclusion -- up to you how to conclude; see the topics list below for suggestions

### Screencast

Record a 5-minute screencast that demos your app's features. You and your team will talk while the screencast is playing. Students in the past have found QuickTime easy to use, but you can use whatever tool you prefer.

Google Drive folders where you'll place your descriptions and final demo videos by 2pm Thursday:

### Topics to include

You don't have to mention _all_ of the following, but consider touching on several of these points. Think about what you want to show off.

Remember, the focus should be on your skills and what you did.

- What part or parts of your app did you work on?
- Talk about relevant personal motivations to work on this project, or relevant prior experience.
- What specifically did you do and how did you do it?
  - How is your app structured?
  - What specific technologies did you use?
  - Did you learn something new for this project that would be interesting to mention?
- Was there a particular challenge you had to solve?
  - Describe what it was and what was tricky about it
  - What did you do to you solve it?
- Was there a technical decision you made that you found interesting?
  - what were your considerations and tradeoffs, and why did you make the decision you did?
- Was there something in particular you learned during this project that you are excited about?
- Are there any features your app has that were technically challenging to implement that you can talk about?
- Suggested conclusion topics:
  - what you plan next for the app
  - what you're excited about doing professionally in your developer jobs
  - notable lessons learned
  - thanks for audience's time

## Q&A Prep

You should be prepared to answer questions about the technical implementation of your app.

Examples questions being given to the panelists include:

- Can you tell me about why you decided to use (insert technology) to build this feature?
- What was one challenge or unexpected thing you encountered during your project, and how did you deal with it?
- What is your favorite thing about this application?
- Did you have to make any hard choices or compromises during development? How did you make that decision?
- What was something new you learned to do or got really good at doing during this project?
- If you were to keep working on this, what is the next feature you would add?
- What did your team do really well together?

### How to Handle Q&A Live

Each person on your team should have an opportunity to speak during Q&A.

You can agree on your team who will take each of the above questions, or categories of questions, if they are asked.

Another way to do this is to take turns with whatever is asked. Plan who will take the first audience question, then the second, then the third.

If itâ€™s your turn and the question is _obviously_ one that is better answered by someone else on the team (because they worked on that feature, for example), you can give a short or partial answer, and then gracefully hand it over to your teammate.

If you are a member of a group that is well represented in the tech industry, you can help to amplify voices that are not usually heard. Please consider handing over speaking time to a teammate if they have not had as much time to speak about technical topics.

#### How to handle a question you don't know the answer to

This is the same advice we have for technical interviews.

- **Pivot to a topic you are prepared to talk about!**
  - Try to make the transition as relevant as you can. You can say "I don't know" if you feel comfortable doing that, but DON'T STOP THERE! Take the opportunity to talk about something you do know.
  - Do not feel compelled to confess that you don't know something and DO NOT APOLOGIZE.
  - **All you have to do is express interest in the question, which shows you are a curious and undaunted continual learner, and keep the conversation going!**
- Example: _"Oh, that's an interesting question. The way we dealt with [that broad issue] in our app is...[insert something you are prepared to talk about]."_
